# Diabetes Prediction Model using SVM

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain diagnostic measures. The model is built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is a powerful classification technique.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict diabetes in individuals based on certain diagnostic measurements. The SVM algorithm is chosen due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source_name]. It includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function.
- **Age**: Age (years).

The target variable to predict is whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).
